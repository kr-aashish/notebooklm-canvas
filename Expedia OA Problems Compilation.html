                topics: "Hashing, Greedy, Sorting",
                hint: "To maximize the number of unique elements removed within the budget of k removals, it is always optimal to remove the elements that are least expensive to eliminate—that is, those with the lowest frequency. The first step, therefore, must be to determine the frequency of each number in the array.",
                approach: `The core strategy is greedy. First, count the frequency of each number using a hash map. Then, to eliminate unique numbers most efficiently, we should remove the numbers that appear least frequently. We can place all the frequencies into a min-heap (priority queue) to easily access the smallest frequencies. We then iteratively remove the smallest frequency groups from the heap as long as our removal budget 'k' allows. The number of unique elements remaining is the final size of the heap.`,

The array is partitioned into four sections: 0s are to the left of 'low', 1s are between 'low' and 'mid', unprocessed elements are between 'mid' and 'high', and 2s are to the right of 'high'. The 'mid' pointer iterates through the array. If nums[mid] is 0, it's swapped with nums[low] and both pointers advance. If it's 1, only 'mid' advances.
